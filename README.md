## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub!, I'm currently working as an AI/ML Scientist at the National Atmospheric Research Laboratory, Department of Space, and a Senior Research Fellow (SRF) at IIT Roorkee, pursuing a PhD. Exploring communication-efficient and privacy-preserving techniques in federated learning (FL). My research focuses on advancing Personalized-FL through hyperparameter optimization, adaptive clustering, and meta-learning strategies. I actively study model personalization across non-IID and geographically distributed data, aiming to improve performance in real-world decentralized environments.

### 🔬 My Core Research Interests

- ⚙️ **Communication-Efficient Federated Learning**
  - Reducing model update overhead with sparsification and quantization
  - Optimizing device-server communication under bandwidth and energy constraints

- 👥 **Personalization in FL via Clustering**
  - Clustering clients based on data distribution or system heterogeneity
  - Developing personalized FL algorithms for non-IID and real-world skewed datasets

- 🌍 **Air Quality Prediction using Federated Learning**
  - Modeling pollution dynamics across cities using LSTM and temporal features
  - Protecting data privacy across regions while achieving high prediction accuracy
